# Demonstration of complete ocean functionality

For this demo we use the Ocean Network available on Polygon. 

*Note that there is an Ethereum private key provided by us, please consider this key as compromised and do not use it for anything apart from this demo*.
This agent is available under `src/ocean_end_2_end`.

In order to launch the application, the demonstration agent can be launched as so;

```bash
make run_app
```

This will launch and an agent which will run through a complete demonstration of the the Ocean Connection.
